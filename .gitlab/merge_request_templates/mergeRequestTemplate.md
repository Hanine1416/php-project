     <footer>
#
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that        
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a  
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this merge is  
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, …)
#             * refactor
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * perf : improve performance
#             * build : update build system or external dependencies (npm, gulp, webpack, make…)
#             * ci (maintain): update CI-CD configuration files
#             * perf : improve performance
#             * revert : cancel old commit
#             * docs :  add updates on documentation
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit   
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in  
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not            
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and     
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in  
#    imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking      
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that  
#    this merge closes
